 It is a powerful operator that allows us to receive all items at once from a publisher. It collects all received elements and emits a single array of the collection when the upstream publisher finishes.
 
 Here, we can see that publisher values are displayed as a single element.

 Note: If we donâ€™t use .collect() operator here then it will simply print as a separate element in a new line instead of a single array.
