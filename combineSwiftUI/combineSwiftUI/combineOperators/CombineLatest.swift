/*
 
 It combines different publishers of different value types. The emitted output is a tuple with the latest values of all publishers whenever any of them emit a value.
 
 Before .combineLatest emits something, each publisher must emit at least a value.

 Letâ€™s understand it with an example.
 
 As shown here, the original publisher combines with the latest value of another publisher and makes combinations accordingly.

 Consider a real-world example where we have a phone number and country name UITextFields and a button to allow us to go ahead with the process. We want to disable that button until we have enough digits of a phone number and the correct country. We can easily achieve this by using the .combineLatest operator.
